<!-- I am applying for Financial Aid because having a certificate will help me to boost up my CV and followed by getting chances for potential employment. Also my learning will be officially recognized which will be appreciable for my career too but I am merely able to pay the amount needed. I am from a lower-middle class family and earning is not up to the mark taking inflation into account. Being a student I don't really earn and the only way for me to get potential certificates and skills in my Resume is through online courses. Also another fact is, after learning for few days, I got very familiar with this course pattern. It is understandable and easy to learn, so I wanted this course to finish and with certificate. I hope to get allowed for the aid, for the sake of my career goals. That is why I am applying for it. -->
<!-- I am a Computer Science Engineering Student and knowing Machine Learning will help me to get into many fields such as research or industry. Also this can be applied in potential other fields. Knowing ML may help me to be a better researcher in field of data science along with giving me a honorable attribute in career. So, as a result of all, I may be able to succeed and achieve goals more accurately. Machine Learning is associated with Artificial Intelligence and together they make one of the prime fields of research in today's world. I am already a junior researcher in the field of Bioinformatics. I believe applying ML concepts will help me to get better results. Also, in future I will be able to learn more about Data Science. In this way I may become able to access many branches of Computer Science and Interdisciplinary Data research together. -->
